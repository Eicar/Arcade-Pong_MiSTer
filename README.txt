Q&A
---

-Q: How accurate is this implementation?
 A: This implementation is based on the original Atari schematics. However, the
    original hardware consists of both digital (sync+async logic) and analog circuits. The analog circuits
    are simulated using digital logic. All signals should be accurate to the system clock edges (7.159MHz).

-Q: Help! I'm unable to move the paddles using the keyboard!
 A: Currently only analog joystick controls are supported.

-Q: Help! I'm unable to move the paddle to the top of the screen!
 A: This is not a bug. The original hardware design did not allow for this to happen.

-Q: The core "reset" does not seem to work
 A: This is true. The original Pong hardware did not support a global "reset" signal.
    I might add support for this in the future.

-Q: Can you please add support for XXX!
 A: I will probably not add features not present in the original game.
    This core is all about accuracy. 

-Q: I've found a bug!
 A: Please let me know about it! I really want this core to be as accurate as possible.
    I will make sure you will get credit for it!

-Q: This core is awesome! How can I make a donation?
 A: All donations are welcome and extremely appreciated! Donations will make it possible
    for me to spend more time on writing new cores.
